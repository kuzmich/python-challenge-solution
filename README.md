This repo contains my solutions to the excelent [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com) puzzles.
You can [view the code here on GitHub](solution.ipynb), or you can actually
[run the code (and play with it)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kuzmich/python-challenge-solution/master?filepath=solution.ipynb)
in the full-featured [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).

Also you can play with the code on your computer as well:

1. Clone the repo:

        git clone https://github.com/kuzmich/python-challenge-solution.git python-challenge
        cd python-challenge

2. Make the virtualenv:

        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
    
3. Install the requirements:
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
4. Run the notebook:

        jupyter notebook solution.ipynb
